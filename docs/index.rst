DepBuilder Documentation
======================================

DepBuilder is a Jenkins plugin used for building complex projects
with a lot of dependencies that should be built in the specific order.

**Example:**
Say we have 4 jobs (A, B, C, D) which we would like to build in a specific order.
The build itself shouldnâ€™t take more than 20 minutes and the job C should be
built on a Windows machine.

   :alt: Initial definition of the build order. Jobs A, B should be built before C and job C
         should be built before job D.

With the |Product| plugin we could define such build pipeline with the following script:

.. code-block:: cpp

    _BUILD {
        maxDuration: 00:20
    }

    C {
        agent: [windows_runner]
    }

    A -> C
    B -> C
    C -> D


After building the pipeline, you should be able to see a similar build graph to the one below:
